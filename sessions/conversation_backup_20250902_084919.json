The frontend should feature:\n\n**Core Functionality:**\n- Chat interface with message history display\n- Model selection dropdown (showing available models from Ollama)\n- Real-time message streaming from the API\n- Clear chat button to reset conversation\n\n**UI Requirements:**\n- Use Bootstrap 5 for responsive design\n- Clean, modern chat interface with message bubbles\n- Input area with send button\n- Loading indicators during API requests\n- Error handling and display messages\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n- Make HTTP requests to Ollama's /api/generate endpoint\n- Handle streaming responses properly\n- Implement proper CORS handling (since this is a local network address)\n- Include basic input validation\n- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop\n\n**User Experience:**\n- Smooth scrolling to latest messages\n- Visual distinction between user and AI messages\n- Clear visual feedback during loading states\n- Error messages for API connection issues\n\nPlease provide the complete frontend code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file or clearly separated files that can be easily deployed.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- The Ollama server is running locally on 192.168.3.70:11434\n- Models should be fetched dynamically from the API endpoint /api/tags\n- Include sample models in the dropdown if API connection fails\n- Handle network timeouts gracefully"
