        "enhanced_description": "**\n\n\"Create a web-based chat interface that integrates with Ollama API running at 192.168.3.70:11434. The frontend should be built with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive UI that includes:\n\n1. **Model Selection**: Dropdown menu to choose from available Ollama models\n2. **Chat Interface**: Message history display with user and AI messages clearly differentiated\n3. **Input Area**: Text input field with send button\n4. **Real-time Streaming**: Handle streaming responses from Ollama API as they arrive\n5. **Error Handling**: Display meaningful error messages for network issues or API errors\n6. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during API requests\n7. **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices\n8. **Clean UI Elements**: Use Bootstrap components for buttons, cards, and layout\n\nKey technical requirements:\n- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) with fetch API or Axios for HTTP requests\n- Implement proper CORS handling for local network communication\n- Include proper input validation and sanitization\n- Handle connection timeouts gracefully\n- Support for multiple chat sessions\n- Local storage to remember selected model between sessions\n\nThe interface should be visually appealing with Bootstrap's grid system, responsive design principles, and intuitive user flow. Make sure the API integration properly handles streaming responses from Ollama's chat endpoint.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\nThis is a local development setup where Ollama is running on the same network but different IP address. The frontend needs to communicate with this specific API endpoint without requiring additional authentication for local testing."
