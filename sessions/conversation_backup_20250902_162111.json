        "enhanced_description": "**\n\n\"Create a web-based chat interface that integrates with Ollama API running at 192.168.3.70:11434. The frontend should allow users to:\n\n1. Select from available AI models hosted on the Ollama server\n2. Have a clean, responsive chat interface using Bootstrap 5 CSS framework\n3. Send messages and receive real-time responses from the selected model\n4. See message history with clear distinction between user and AI messages\n5. Include proper error handling for API connectivity issues\n6. Support basic UI elements like model selection dropdown, message input field, send button, and clear chat button\n\nKey technical requirements:\n- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) with fetch API for HTTP requests\n- Implement proper CORS handling since this is a local network setup\n- Include loading states during API requests\n- Make the interface responsive for both desktop and mobile devices\n- Add basic security considerations for local network access\n- Ensure smooth scrolling to latest messages\n- Include proper input validation and user feedback\n\nThe UI should be visually appealing with Bootstrap's grid system, appropriate spacing, and clear visual hierarchy. The chat window should automatically scroll to show the most recent messages.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\nThis is a local development setup where Ollama is running on a separate machine in the same network. The frontend needs to communicate securely within this local network environment while providing a professional user experience."
